How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps me to quickly spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could let me know how the file evolve over time, which is helpful especially wehn I need to pick up the file really quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing:
 
	pros:
	1. You can decide when to commit and make each commit more meaningful and logical
	2. File history might be cleaner
	3. Donâ€™t take up too much memory space for version-related files(?)

	cons:
	1. You may forget to commit
	2. You may wait too long before committing
	3. You get extra work when committing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

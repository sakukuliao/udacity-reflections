How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps me to quickly spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could let me know how the file evolve over time, which is helpful especially wehn I need to pick up the file really quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing:
 
	pros:
	1. You can decide when to commit and make each commit more meaningful and logical
	2. File history might be cleaner
	3. Don’t take up too much memory space for version-related files(?)

	cons:
	1. You may forget to commit
	2. You may wait too long before committing
	3. You get extra work when committing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	I think it’s useful particularly when there are multiple somewhat relate files.
	With multiple files in one commit, we can know the exact project state at the that time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	For git log, I can use it to view the history of commits. I can see when each commit is made, by whom, and the purpose. 
	Therefore, I can use it compare different state of my project.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I would be more certain that I can go back in time for any versions I’ve changed.
    This frees me from worrying that something would be missing while changes are made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to use git for my iOS app. Make my workflow more professional and efficient.

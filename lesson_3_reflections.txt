1)  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I need to collaborate with others or when I need to store my files on a remote computer.

2)	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I don't want my local copy get containminated by the remote one before I amsure that my local copy has reached a steady state and is ready to be merged.

3)	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is a term used by Github to note that one can copy a particular branch(a series of commits) from another GitHub account.

	Cloning is a git command for copying a repository from a remote repo.

	Branching is a git command to label commits. By labeling commits, we can quickly jump between different commits and denote diffrent purposes for the labeled commits.

	For usage.

	I would use forking when I find some repo on GitHub that I would like to try it out and contribute.

	For cloning, one ocassion is that I use it to let my local computer holds the same copy as the remote one.

	For branching, the most useful case is when I need to experient a new feature or fix bugs or develop a different language settings.

4)	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If I get hold of the last known state of the remote, in the case of collaboration, I can be sure that my work will not accidentally be mixed up with others' work. And I can get a picture of where others are heading for.
